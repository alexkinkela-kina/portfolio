# Alex Kinkela - Web Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal web development portfolio repository.

I am a beginner web developer focused on visual web projects, clean UI layouts and simple practical websites. I am currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and building my first project portfolio while living and working in Denmark. My long-term goal is to move into professional frontend and freelance work.
